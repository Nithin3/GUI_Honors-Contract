# GUI_Honors-Contract

## What does the program do? ##

This project called Application Station, predictable by it’s name, 
involves a game known as SoS (basically tic-tac-toe), a calculator and a restaurant management system. 
**The description is only about the SoS Game, later I included the other two apps to this project**
  
  When I got to know about this project 
  requirement, I thought about my school life where me and my friends used to play this game on 
  the last page of our notes. I used that knowledge and wrote a code which works normally on the 
  console, but I did not wanted anyone to say that it’s easy and could be easily done using online codes.
  So, I took the same code into GUI (Graphical User Interface) and implemented on it. I kept on thinking 
  of something new, while many different ideas flown, I thought that my project would be more compelling if
  I use Login System. Now, when we run the program on any IDE, it prints a greeting message and then asks us 
  to create a Game Account to proceed further, i.e playing SoS. After giving user’s desired username and password
  , it asks us to confirm password. If user’s two entered passwords do not match, the program ends and gives
  no output. If both the passwords match, a Login System window would get opened and asks us to enter account 
  details to play SoS. If the user’s account details match that of the created user’s details, a new window 
  gets opened where the user could enjoy playing SoS. If the account details entered do not match, it displays 
  an error message saying that entered details are invalid. This is obviously a two player game, so for now, 
  let us think that two can play by creating an account. The window also involves a reset button, so when the 
  user clicks that button, everything what they played vanishes making user play a fresh game. If someone wins 
  the game, it displays a message congratulating the player who won and if there is no win, i.e if no one wins, 
  it displays a message saying that the game is a draw.

## Requirements: ##

The requirement for this project was to demonstrate my knowledge of the topics we learned in CSE 110 - Programming with Java.
The topics we discussed were Primitive Data Types, Classes and Methods, conditionals, loops and arrays. 
I tried my best to use them all. Also, I had to self learn a lot as I used GUI which is not in the topics discussed in the class.		

• The Basics and Primitive Data Types: Obviously, my java program consists items such as print statements and all kinds of data types including strings, integers, and more. 

• Instance Variables and objects: I used instance variables in my Login_Systems class such as username and password. I used objects such as btn1,btn2.. , frmSos in the main class(Sos_Gui).

• Classes and methods: No code would be called “organised code” if we don’t use different classes and methods.
The project consists of two classes named Sos_Gui and Login_Systems. It has nine methods with the major part of code written in initialize() method.

• Conditionals: My whole project mainly relies on if-else conditional statements. For example, to display error message when the user’s entered details do not match account details, if-else statement is must.
